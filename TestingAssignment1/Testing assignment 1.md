**Software Test Lab 1 (10 points)**

First read the following papers (you have access to all these papers if you are on the university network!), and familiarize yourself with test case generation and crash replication. 

- Search-based Software Test Data Generation: A Survey. Phil McMinn, 2004
https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dad0/ae85f7a2cfbff1d44098347f6c00f90f8a9a.pdf

- Formal analysis of the effectiveness and predictability of random testing. Andrea Arcuri, Muhammad Zohiaib Iqbal, Lionel Briand, 2010.

- Whole Test Suite Generation. G. Fraser and A. Arcuri, 2013.
http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6152257/

- A Guided Genetic Algorithm for Automated Crash Reproduction, Mozhan Saltani, Annibale Panichella, and Arie van Deursen, which is not yet published but available for download from the git repository for the assignment.

- The Impact of Test Case Summaries on Bug Fixing Performance: An Empirical Investigation. S. Panichella, A. Panichella, M. Beller, A. Zaidman, H. Gall

**Stage 1**

Perform the experiments as Mozhan provided them. *Please* do this individually, it should take you less than 2 hours.

**Stage 2**

Write a small report (at most 6 A4 pages, font-size at least 10) that discusses how search-based software testing in general and crash replication specifically helps in finding bugs. As a guideline, these are the required elements of your report. If you feel the need to go beyond these elements, you are free to do so (with a maximum bonus of 2).

Important: Your report should be understandable to a fellow student with no knowledge of advanced testing and reversing techniques.

Required elements:

1. Introduction: what is search-based software engineering and what is its importance w.r.t. automatic test code generation and crash replication.
2. Explain how tests are automatically generated, e.g., using EvoSuite (core concepts)
3. Detailed description of how EvoCrash works.
4. How did EvoCrash help you in your debugging assignments.
5. Reflect on how EvoCrash could have helped you in your own programming endeavours (1 example is enough)
6. Reflect on how EvoCrash could still be improved.
7. Reflect on whether you would apply EvoSuite/EvoCrash in your own daily programming routines. Why (not)?

(obviously you should combine your individual experiences from stage 1 w.r.t. items 4-7)

Hint: in order to come up with bonus parts, maybe you should try EvoCrash yourself on an actual exception... Remember, EvoCrash can be found here: [https://github.com/Mozhan/EvoCrash-Hands-on](https://github.com/Mozhan/EvoCrash-Hands-on)

Keep in mind that your paper will be peer reviewed by fellow students!

**Which assignment to do?**

4 assignments have been created for EvoCrash. They are all in the github repo. Each team member gets assigned a different assignment to let you experience similar, yet slightly different situations. Your report should reflect the combined experiences. 

These are the student/assignment combinations
