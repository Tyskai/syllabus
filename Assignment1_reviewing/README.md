# Reviewing assignment 1

Deadline: March 30th, 2017 23:59


If your assignment was about test, you are going to review 2 reversing assignments and vice versa.

How to proceed?

1. Look at the table below to see which 2 assignments you need to review. 
2. Download both and read them, make notes if you feel the need (e.g., when things are not clear)
3. Fill in the Google Forms. 

  1. Please perform your review seriously, as your feedback will be partially used to determine your fellow student's grade (so treat the reviewing assignment as you yourself want to be reviewed: thoroughly and fair!)
  2. Please fill in the code of the assignment correct, so Test-X or Rev-Y. Really important for our bookkeeping.

4. As you will see, the Google Form has 4 parts:

	1. Your details + the assignment code (e.g., Test-1)
	2. Detailed questions about each section of the assignment. Most questions require 1 "tick", but in case you are "in the middle between 2 options", you can also tick 2 (adjacent) answers.
	3. You need to mention 3 strong points and 3 points for improvements.
	4. Free space for additional remarks that you feel have not been covered by the previous questions.
