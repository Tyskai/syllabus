We are going to do model based test generation and execution on programs from the RERS 2016 and 2017 challenges.

The first step is to download and install fMBT:

fMBT - https://01.org/fmbt

The easiest way to get fMBT installed is on a Ubuntu (Linux) machine, because it just needs the following commands in the right order:

```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:antti-kervinen/fmbt-devel
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install fmbt*
```

That's all.
